                <p><a href="#">David Cooper - Writer</a> Apr 04, 2020, 3:30 PM</p>
                <h3>Hotcars magazine has just released a list of the top 10 best off-road motorcycles in
                    the world in 2020. </h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>From an outsider's perspective, off-road motorcycles look very similar. They all follow the same
                    fender, fork and aerodynamic design. If you are not a professional, you will only be able
                    to distinguish them by color.</p>
                <p>However, in reality, there is no motorcycle exactly like its competitors, there are some that
                    really stand out, rising to become stars in the segment. Hotcars magazine has evaluated and
                    honored the 10 best off-road motorcycles in 2020 in the list below.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">1. KTM 450 SX-F</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/ktm_450_sx-f.jpg" alt="">
                    <figcaption class="font">Close-up of the KTM 450 SX-F. Photo: 9tro</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The number one position belongs to the 450 SX-F off-road motorcycle of KTM. This is an off-road
                    motorcycle that has often been ranked at the top for many years.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/ktm_450_sx-f_01.jpg" alt="">

                </figure>
                <p>With eye-catching vibrant orange tones, fierce sporty styling, famous KTM brand, this car is always
                    the desire of fans. Each component and part that makes up the car is evaluated by experts as having
                    a standard structure and design. The only downside of the KTM 450 SX-F is the price tag of up to
                    $11,000 (255 million).</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">2. Honda CRF450-WE</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/crf450-we.jpg" alt="">
                    <figcaption class="font">Honda CRF450-WE is a limited product with many advanced features. Photo:

                </figure>
                <p>In the field of manufacturing cars and racing cars, Honda always satisfies customers with products
                    with impressive performance. Even if Honda does not achieve good results in the 2020 off-road
                    motorcycle racing season, this car company is always trying to improve and develop products.
                    And that's why the Honda CRF450-WE was born.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The Honda CRF450-WE is not a regular CRF product. The 'WE' at the end stands for 'Works Edition'.
                    This is a limited edition equipped with the most advanced technology that the Honda racing
                    team currently has.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">3. Kawasaki KX450F</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/kx450f.jpg" alt="">

                </figure>
                <p>Like the two models KTM 450 SX-F and Honda CRF450-WE mentioned above, the Kawasaki KX450F
                    is also an off-road motorcycle with a 450cc engine. To control these large capacity vehicles
                    requires the driver to have many years of experience.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>With a capacity of nearly 60 horsepower combined with a chassis weighing only approximately 110 kg,
                    the Kawasaki KX450F is one of the fastest bikes in the off-road motorcycle segment.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">4. KTM 300 XC TPI</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>For non-specialist customers, a smaller capacity model can be found, the KTM 300 XC TPI with a
                    300cc two-stroke engine.</p>
                <p>According to the advertising agency KTM, the KTM 300 XC TPI uses fuel injection technology (TPI -
                    Transfer Port Injection) to help save fuel significantly compared to cars using carburetors.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>In addition, this model is considered to have a neutral design that can be used for many purposes
                    from Motocross, Supercross racing or simply going out for a picnic.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">5. Kawasaki KX250</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The next bike on the list is a 250cc off-road motorcycle from Kawasaki. It can be said that the
                    Kawasaki KX250 has a lot of similarities compared to competitors in the 250cc segment. However,
                    what makes the KX250 different is that this bike is very solid and durable.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>With the same 250cc capacity, the Yamaha YZ250 is currently a direct competitor of the Kawasaki KX250</p>
                <p>This car is currently considered by Yamaha as its flagship product, and is equipped with many modern
                    features. Customers can choose between two-stroke or four-stroke engine versions depending on
                    their preferences. However, experts consider the two-stroke engine to be more suitable on the track.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>While Kawasaki's KX product line is intended for off-road Motocross and Supercross racers,
                    the Kawasaki KLX230R is specifically designed for those who love trail riding.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/klx_230_r_01.jpg" alt="">

                </figure>
                <p>The 230cc engine is quite suitable for inexperienced riders, although it is not as powerful
                    as the 450cc, 500cc engines, but it is enough for the basic requirements and provides a pleasant
                    driving feeling.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">8. Husqvarna FE 350</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>With a 350cc engine, the Husqvarna FE 350 is designed for off-road use. Off-road vehicles (Enduro)
                    often have long forks, durable engines, large fuel tanks to be able to operate at long ranges,
                    and most importantly, it is completely legal to run on the street.</p>
                <figure>

                <p>However, the car company Husqvarna still likes to call the FE 350 a "Dual Sport" car
                    (both onroad and offroad).</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">9. KTM 500 EXC-F</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>KTM 500 EXC-F is currently a direct competitor of Husqvarna FE 350 in the Enduro segment. However,
                    the KTM 500 EXC-F has a larger engine, with a capacity of 500cc.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The highlight of the KTM 500 EXC-F is its impressive power-to-weight ratio. As KTM claims, the
                    engine in the KTM 500 EXC-F is one of the smallest, lightest, and most powerful engines available.</p>
                <h3 class="font_color">10. Yamaha YZ-125X</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Last on the list is a 125cc model from Yamaha, the YZ-125X. This is the right bike for those who
                    are new to off-road motorcycle racing. Although it only has a 125cc engine, the sound the engine
                    produces, the acceleration of the Yamaha YZ-125X is not bad at all.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/yz_125x_01.jpg" alt="">

                </figure>
                <p>Once they get used to this model, riders can switch to larger capacity motorcycles to satisfy their
                    passion.</p>
