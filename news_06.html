            <p>The KTM Factory Editions have been a tradition in the motocross world for over 10 years. These are
                premium-level motocross bikes that are more or less replicas of the machines ridden by Cooper Webb,
                Marvin Musquin and the Red Bull KTM Factory motocross team. Now, off-road riders are getting the same
                treatment. The KTM 350XC-F Factory Edition is a tribute to the bike that Kailub Russell has used to
                dominate the GNCC XC-1 Pro class for eight consecutive years. The bike is a 2022 350XC-F with a long
                list of upgrades, including:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>We got a chance to ride the 2022 KTM 350XC-F in what turned out to be the most demanding GNCC of the
                year: the rain-soaked finale in Crawfordsville, Indianna. Dirt Bike videographer Travis Fant
                volunteered for the duty and came back somewhat traumatized, but intact. Of course, he loved the bike.
                What’s not to love? The 350XC-W not only is the bike that Kailub Russell prefers (although he has raced
                the 450 and 250 at different times), but it’s also the bike used by most EnduroCross riders and a large
                group of Vet motocrossers, who prefer it over the SX for its six-speed gearbox.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Travis is a dedicated motocross rider who owns a 450SX. He instantly fell in love with the 350. It’s
                doubtful that there would have been any better choice for not only for his first GNCC, but his
                first-ever mud survival run. The cool thing about the bike is that it’s not just a Red Bull sticker
                kit. It’s truly thought out for cross-country racing. Case in point, the solid rear brake rotor.
                Kailub and crew learned long ago that the vented rotor wears brake pads at an alarming rate in the mud.
                The fuel tank also can accept a Dry Break quick-fill. Travis declined this feature and used an adapter
                for a threaded gas cap. The last thing he wanted was a quick pit stop. The various guards are all
                thought out well to prevent mud build-up.</p>

            <p>TRAVIS: “In comparison to the 450, I know it’s not much lighter on the scale but it felt lighter.
                Maybe less moving parts? Felt like I could move it around a little more. The suspension was plush
                and had good hold up testing it the day before the race. Raceday everything was different, but the
                suspension was the last of my worries. The motor was “light” feeling and revved to the moon. Third
                gear seemed like it pulled forever out on the corn fields. I liked that it wasn’t as jerky as an SXF
                model in 1st/2nd gear in tight sections. That made for easy throttle control maneuvering the bike
                in trees.</p>
            <p>“Those split triple clamps are the unsung hero of any KTM. Less rigid feeling in the hands! I tested
                map one and two plus traction control beforehand. Not a huge fan of map one. It was a little too
                mellow for my liking. Traction control wasn’t for me either. I’d rather have a little more punch
                when I need it and get to the high rpms where this bike shines. The clutch was good. Brakes never
                had issues in the mud on race day. Tank was large enough for a two-hour race without a pit stop.</p>
            <p>As far as complaints go, KTM needs to fix their electronics suite behind the number plate. It’s exposed
                and wires pull out … on all their models. The FI light cable and start cable does this. Even on
                2016-2018 era KTMs. Don’t need that happening in a GNCC. Seat can be harsh on some people butts. I
                like the extra grip but it’s not for everyone. I would run the Acerbis frame guards instead of the
                plastic ones on the bike. The Acerbis guards are great in the wet. Webb got a lot of riders hooked
                on those guards after the San Diego mudder a couple years ago. ” For Travis Fant’s full story and tips
                for other GNCC newbies, check out the February, 2022 print edition of Dirt Bike.</p>
