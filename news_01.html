            <p>By: <a href="#">Lewis Duncan</a> Nov 30, 2021, 10:30 PM</p>
            <h3>Double MotoGP race winner Danilo Petrucci says his switch from road racing to rallying ahead of his
                Dakar debut in 2022 has been “completely another world”. </h3>
            <video controls width="640"><source src="videos/MotoGP%20winner%20Petrucci%20says%20Dakar%20switch%20is%20“another%20world”.mp4"></video>

            <p>Petrucci will make a unique career switch in 2022 after bringing his MotoGP tenure to an end earlier this month at the Valencia finale having lost his Tech 3 KTM ride for next year.</p>
            <p>The Italian will remain with KTM and Tech 3 in 2022 but will contend the famous Dakar Rally, which has been a dream of his for some time.</p>
            <p>Petrucci completed some desert running in Dubai ahead of the final MotoGP rounds of 2021 and has continued his preparations following the conclusion of the season.</p>
            <p>Speaking ahead of the Valencia finale, Petrucci says everything about his switch to rallying has been a huge adjustment – while noting he is yet to determine what the rest of his 2022 season will look like.</p>
            <p>“The biggest thing to learn in the Dakar is everything because it’s completely another world,” Petrucci said.</p>
            <p>“I think already in one week of training I did more than the distance that I did all this year with a MotoGP bike.</p>
            <p>“So, I’m completely new and fortunately I have some quite good skills for riding.</p>
            <p>“But then the navigation is really, really something you need to understand because here [in MotoGP] we talk about metres and millimetres on the bike.</p>
            <p>“There you talk about kilometres, and you never know what’s going on.</p>
            <p>“For this reason, I will do this Dakar, then we will sit down a bit with KTM and will decide what the plan is for the year after, if I enjoy to do these kinds of races or try to do something different.</p>
            <p>“But at the moment I’m quite busy doing that because I need a lot of time to recover and especially, to understand how the race can be.”</p>
            <p>Dakar organisers confirmed the details of the 2022 rally last weekend, which will be staged in Saudi Arabia and take place for two weeks from January 1 through to 14 January 14.</p>
            <p>The 2022 Dakar will count towards the new FIA World Cross-Country Rally Championships, while the event will also form part of the equivalent FIM rally series. </p>
